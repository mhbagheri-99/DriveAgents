# Drive Agents
## _A Short Study on Learning Agents Plugin_

In this project, I followed the official tutorial on [Epic Games Dev Community]. On this tutorial, we covered the basics of reinforcement learning by setting up learning agents, their interactor (observation and action), their trainor (reward/penalty system, completion procedure and resetting the episodes of learning), their policy and finally how to manage all of these components using learning agents manager. I also got the chance to have a hands-on experience on spline, an important component by which we can have access to very useful data in our gameplay. I found this tutorial very informative and will definitely take into consideration to implement RL using this plugin in my upcoming projects. Although this feature is still in experimental phase and may contain some bugs and limitations, it has the potential to be super handy in projects especially when the developer is neither professionally involved with RL coding nor have the time for it.
